## Introduction

This project is the backend of Vidly.

Following a course that builds upon from previous work creating a node backend for an imaginary video rental app, I have created a front end in React for viewing and editing a Movie Store's database.

I have been developing the Node backend and React frontend further on my GitHub repositories to make the project my own - https://github.com/JelliottR/vidly-frontend + https://github.com/JelliottR/vidly-backend.

Current Features
- Pagination
- Categories
- Authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) - also allowing for token protected routes
- Searching 
- Edit a movie
- Post a new movie
- Validation (when creating an account, logging in and editing a movie)
- Permissions (only an admin can delete a movie)
- Integrated Sentry to track and be alerted to HTTP errors
